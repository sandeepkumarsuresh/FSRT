Official GitHub repository for [FSRT: Facial Scene Representation Transformer for Face Reenactment from Factorized Appearance, Head-pose, and Facial Expression Features](https://andrerochow.github.io/fsrt) (accepted to CVPR 2024) by Andre Rochow, Max Schwarz, and [Sven Behnke](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/). <br>

## Example Animations
The animated sequences (bottom row) are generated by transferring the motion extracted from the driving video (left) to the person in the source image (top row).

### VoxCeleb Dataset
The source images and driving videos are selected from the official VoxCeleb test set. We demonstrate both animation modes,  absolute and relative motion transfer, supported by our method.

#### 1. Absolute Motion Transfer
https://github.com/andrerochow/fsrt/assets/56793847/b56027f0-3e63-471c-bafe-edff21c6c090

#### 2. Relative Motion Transfer
https://github.com/andrerochow/fsrt/assets/56793847/6f88911f-3572-4a3b-a17e-88994cdca22e

### CelebA-HQ Dataset
Our model generalizes to source images from the CelebA-HQ dataset and driving videos from the official VoxCeleb2 test set.

## Setup
Please complete the following steps.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/andrerochow/fsrt.git
cd fsrt
```

We recommend to create a new conda environment:

```
conda create -n fsrt python=3.9
conda activate fsrt
```

### Dependencies

This code requires at least Python 3.9 and PyTorch.

 1. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>= 1.12.0)

 2. Additional dependencies can be installed via:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 3. In case you want to animate with relative motion transfer and automatically find a best-matching frame, you need to install the face-alignment library:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment
    cd face-alignment
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install
    ```

### Pretrained Checkpoints

Pretrained models can be found at [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R9BuWM-kqPddriZtIVf5z3Yq14D4DDSP?usp=drive_link).

The keypoint detector weights should be located at `fsrt_checkpoints/kp_detector.pt`. Note that all pretrained checkpoints are trained using the same keypoint detector weights.

## Animation Demo

#### Animate with Relative Motion Transfer (Better ID Preservation):

```
python demo.py --checkpoint fsrt_checkpoints/vox256.pt --config runs/vox256/vox256.yaml  --source_image path/to/source --driving_video path/to/driving  --source_idx 0 --relative --adapt_scale --find_best_frame
```

#### Animate with Absolute Motion Transfer:

```
python demo.py --checkpoint fsrt_checkpoints/vox256.pt --config runs/vox256/vox256.yaml  --source_image path/to/source --driving_video path/to/driving --source_idx 0
```

## VoxCeleb Dataset

Download the VoxCeleb dataset by following the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/video-preprocessing). 
We strongly recommend saving the videos in `.mp4` format at the highest possible resolution, as they will be cropped to implement out-of-frame motion. 
In our case, we resized the larger dimension of each video to match the smaller dimension (e.g. 608x512 â†’ 512x512). 

Once the dataset is downloaded, run the `extract_keypoints.py` script on the videos:

```
python3 extract_keypoints.py --folder_in path/to/videos/ --folder_out path/to/output_folder/
```
This will store the [face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment) keypoints required for data augmentation.

Finally, split the training videos into `path/to/data/train_videos/` for training and `path/to/data/val_videos` for validation.

## Training

To train a FSRT model run:

```
torchrun --rdzv-backend=c10d --rdzv-endpoint=localhost:$PORT --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node $NUM_GPUS train.py runs/vox256/vox256.yaml
```

The model checkpoints are automatically saved to the directory where the `.yaml` config file is located.

## Acknowledgement

Our FSRT implementation ist based on the PyTorch implementation of [Scene Representation Transformer](https://github.com/stelzner/srt) and [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model).
